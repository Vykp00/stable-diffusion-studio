[Studio.ai](https://studio-ai-uqw8.onrender.com/) is a friendly stable diffusion space for beginners. You can experiment different Generative AI models by inputting text prompts to generate high-resolution images. Registered users can:
* Input text prompt to generate images
* Choose different models to use (e.g. [stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1?text=a+blue+bird), [runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5))
* Once the image is generated, the user can download the image 
* Save it on your Gallery on Studio.ai's storage
* Use images for commercial or personal use.

## Manual

1. When you first access Studio.ai, You will see the guest screen.
<br />
<img src="samples/Guest.png" alt="Guest sample" title="Studio AI Guest screen" height="400" />

2. Next, you'll need to sign up by filling your email and passwords.
<br />
<img src="samples/Signup.png" alt="Sign up sample" title="Studio AI Sign up screen" height="400" />

Once you've successfully signed up, you will be redirected to the Log in screen. After entering the correct emails and passwords, you will see the main homepage where you can finally try out the AI models.

3. First, enter the text prompt that describe the images that you want to generate. You can be as specific as possible like in the example or just as simple as "a red fox". The key is to experiments. Then choose the models that you want to try out.
<br />
<img src="samples/Modelform.png" alt="Model form sample" title="Studio AI Model Form screen" height="400" />

4. Now, click **Generate** and wait :hourglass: ... Note that if the **Loading...** is done yet your image is not shown, it means the AI model server might be overloaded due to high traffic, you can try it later or use different AI models.
<img src="samples/Loading.png" alt="Loading sample" title="Studio AI Loading screen" height="350" />

5. Tadaa! :sparkles: Your image is here. Now you can add it to your gallery or try a new prompt if you're not happy with the results. Keep in mind the previous image, and its metadata will be lost if you don't add it to your gallery before generating a new one. You can find all your saved images at **My Gallery**

## Development
If you want to develop or modify the code locally. Follow the following instructions. If you want to contribute to this project. Please refer to the [support links](#support-links) section.

Pre-requisites
</summary> <br />
First, make sure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

###
- Node.js (Recommend install NodeJS with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to prevent future version conflict)
- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/installation/#install-flask)(Create a virtual environment)
- Python 3.10
- [Redis](https://redis.io/docs/install/install-redis/) (If you plan to develop on Windows, read the [Redis doc on installation on Windows](https://redis.io/docs/install/install-redis/install-redis-on-windows/))
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

Setting up Clientside
</summary> <br />

1. Fork or clone the repository and install dependencies for server side
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vykp00/stable-diffusion-studio.git
```
2. Now navigate to the `client` folder and set up its dependencies by running the `package.json` file
```bash
npm install
```
After it's successfully installed, create a `.env.local` file and add the following text:
```
REACT_APP_PROXY_DOMAIN=http://127.0.0.1:5000
```
This will help React client side to communicate with the Flask server side

3. Now you can test the front end application by running. If it's running, you can move on to setting up the server
```bash
npm start
```
</details>

<summary>
Setting up Server side
</summary> <br />
1. Next, install all dependencies for your server side. Remember to activate your [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/venv.html)


```bash
pip install -r requirements. txt
```

2. If everything is ok, now we need to configure your server to communicate with your database PostgreSQL, Redis, Microsoft Azure Storage and HuggingFace (for calling model API). First, create a Postgres database, here you should get your `URI` for `SQLAlchemy` to connect to your database: 
`postgresql://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@localhost/<DATABASE_NAME>`. For Redis, it should be the address when you run `redis-cli` (by default, it will be `127.0.0.1:6379`)

3. Then, [create your Azure Blob Storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal). Now you need to set credentials to [connect to your blob storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-python?tabs=connection-string%2Croles-azure-portal%2Csign-in-visual-studio-code). You can either use Passwordless or Connection Strings (I'm using Connection Strings since you won't need to install Azure CLI)

4. Now all it left is your `TOKEN KEY` from your Hugging Face account. If you do not submit your API token when sending requests to the API, you will not be able to run inference on your private models. You can get your API token from [your profile settings](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/quicktour#get-your-api-token)

5. Now all you need to 
`.env` file on your server folder. This file will store all your secret keys, API tokens that will be used to configure your server. You should not share this file to public so make sure the file is listed in your `.gitignore` 
```
SDAPI_TOKEN="YOUR-HUGGINGFACE-API-TOKEN"
SECRET_KEY="YOUR-SECRET-KEY" # your secret password for the application
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI="postgresql://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@localhost/<DATABASE_NAME>"
SESSION_REDIS="redis://[YOUR-REDIS-URL]"
AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING="YOUR-AZURE-CONNECTION-STRING"
```
6. Now you're all set. Run the server side by running this from `server` directory:
```bash
flask run
```
OR from the `client` directory
```bash
cd .. && npm run start-server
```
You should also start the `client` side too:
```bash
npm start
```
</details>

Now, you're free to test out different models of Stable Diffusion privately

## Deployment
Before deployment your application, you need to build your static folder on the client side:
```bash
npm run build
```
There are many options to host your React Flask App such as [Render](https://render.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [Railway](https://railway.app/). I'm using Render since you can deploy all parts in one place.

### Render
1. Create PostgreSQL and Redis database on Render.
2. Deploy Flask Server Side as web service. Follow [this](https://render.com/docs/deploy-flask) instructions and make sure your set **Root Directory** as your `server` folder in the setting. You also need to specify your Python version `PYTHON_VERSION`, and other variables that were stored on your `.env` file. This time replace your local PostgreSQL and Redis url with Internal Render urls.

**Important Notes: **
* Your environment variable values should be plain text without string syntax `" "` like in your `.env` file.
* Edit PostgreSQL Render url to `postgresql://...` instead of `postgres://...` otherwise SQLAlchemy cannot connect to PostgreSQl. See details [issue](https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/6083)

<img src="samples/render-1.png" alt="Render-Flask" title="Render Flask" height="550" />

3. Once your Server web service is live, you can now move on [deploying your React Static Site](https://render.com/docs/deploy-create-react-app) and make sure your set **Root Directory** as your `client` folder in the setting. Similar to Flask Server, you need to specify `NODE_VERSION` and `REACT_APP_PROXY_DOMAIN` in your environmental variables but this time your proxy domain should be the domain of your Flask web service on Render.

**Important Notes: **
* Use `npm run build` instead of `yarn build` if you have issue with `yarn.lock` file error.
